	<p><strong>Classrooms :</strong> At SIS, the classrooms are spacious, vibrant, child friendly, print rich and well lit. Whether it be the gleaming number line on the wall, the colourful craft work strung across the class, or even bulletin boards, each part of the class contributes to the learning experience of the child. The furniture in each classroom is child friendly and safe. The housekeeping staff on duty on each floor ensures that cleanliness in the classroom is maintained at all times.</p>

	<p><strong>Smart Boards Supported By Tata Class Edge :</strong> Meet Technology, the presiding member of the SIS classroom. Technology in Education is a buzzword today. We have been successful in bringing technology to our classrooms with the introduction of interactive Whiteboards or Smart Boards. These allow students to interact with the lesson content while allowing teachers to integrate a range of resources with their lessons. Technology can be a great way to enable active learning and can be used to learn on one&rsquo;s own or to collaborate with others. The classroom transforms into an interactive forum for sharing experiences among students, thus helping in widening their analytical faculties.</p>
