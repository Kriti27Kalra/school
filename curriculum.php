Third language is Sanskrit from classes V &ndash; VIII and Spanish as hobby classes from IV &ndash; VIII. Computer Science is a compulsory subject for classes I &ndash; VIII. Art and Craft, Music, Dance, Yoga, Taekwondo and Gymnastics are also taught.</p>

<p class="text-justify">For classes IX to XII, the syllabus prescribed by the CBSE is followed.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Work experience, Physical and Health Education and Art Education are part of the syllabus.</p>

<p class="text-justify">An important goal of education is to prepare children for life as adults and to impart knowledge, skills, qualities and attitudes which make them self- supportive individuals and responsible citizens. The new concept of work experience as envisaged by the National Policy on Education, emphasises practical work to satisfy the needs of students, the school and the community. Students are engaged in purposeful activities during which they identify their needs and the needs of others. They acquaint themselves with productive activities of communities and learn the source of raw materials and the use of tools and equipment. They develop skills and sharpen their perceptions and creative abilities and in addition develop respect for manual labour and proper attitude towards regularity, loveforexcellence and dedication to duty along with a deep concern for the environment and their commitment to society.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Value Education is an essential part of the student&rsquo;s training for life. At Somerville International, it is considered one of the most important areas of education. The subject is not restricted to a single period on the timetable, but basic values of life are inculcated in each and every period so that students are able to adjust to varied life situations.</p>                    </div>
