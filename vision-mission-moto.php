<h2 style="color:black;">Vision</h2>

<p>Somerville International School aims to be an institution of excellence where sound ethical values, character, wisdom, leadership, service and academic achievement are encouraged in a safe and nurturing environment.</p>
</div>

<div class="para-content text-justify">
<h2 style="color:black;">Mission</h2>

<p>The mission of the school is to provide an environment that lays emphasis on intellectual and emotional growth in which every student discovers and realises his/her full potential and highest academic standards are achieved; where emphasis is laid on integrity, ethics, moral courage, hard work, responsibility and self-discipline; where activities focus on developing visionaries articulate and confident individuals with sensitivity and concern for the less fortunate, the environment, diversity and communal harmony, human rights and democratic values; where students, teachers, parents and the administration work together as a nurturing community.</p>
</div>

<div class="para-content text-justify">
<h2 style="color:black;">Motto</h2>

<p>The school&rsquo;s motto <strong>&lsquo;LOVE ONE ANOTHER&rsquo;</strong> is the cornerstone around which the character and personality of every child is moulded. The school visualises an educational system based on instilling cardinal values, pursuit of excellence in all things and service to humanity. Thus, as the students step out of the sacrosanct precincts of their alma mater, they are armed with faith in themselves, belief in goodness and righteousness, fortitude to face the buffeting winds of change and a desire to serve humanity.</p>
