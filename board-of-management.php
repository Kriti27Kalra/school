<p>1 Chronicles 16:11 &ndash; In the Bible says, <em>&ldquo;Seek the Lord and His strength, seek His face continually.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>We thank the Almighty for His blessings showered on the school from the early stages of its inception and growth.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that a school website, a hub for all of us showcases the multifarious activities of the students and the school in all realms of teaching and administration. The school is now well-known and recognised as a premier institute in &lsquo;Expressway &ndash; Noida&rsquo; area. A well-designed interactive and accessible website is of paramount importance to the school. Parents and students can actively engage themselves in all areas of school life through the website. We can make this possible with a strong partnership with the parents for which their feedback at regular intervals is imperative.</p>

<p>Best wishes to the school in all its endeavours.</p>                                                            </div>

The Lott Carey Baptist Mission already has three well established schools- Somerville School in Vasundhara Enclave, Somerville School in NOIDA and Somerville School in Greater NOIDA. They have gained a name for themselves by providing admirable standards of education, excellent results in public examinations and a wide range of extra-curricular activities that have made their students a force to be reckoned with at Interschool competitions held in Delhi and the NCR.</p>

<p>With this background and experience, the LCBM in India has been able to provide Somerville International School with an aesthetically designed infrastructure and has equipped it with state of the art equipment. The large airy classrooms have attractive and comfortable furniture, air conditioning and air purifiers in addition to smart boards. The computer labs and science laboratories have been custom-made by professionals. The library is constantly being stocked with a variety of reference books as well as fiction for different age groups. Games, sports and activities are given as much importance as academics.</p>

<p>The school has its own fleet of buses ensuring the safety, security and comfort for our students. CCTV cameras cover the classrooms, corridors and grounds for further security of our staff and students.</p>

<p>Above all, the school has well-qualified, dedicated teachers who are guided by the Principal. The Administrative staff and support staff carry out their duties diligently to keep the school neat and clean and ensure that all systems function as desired.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity to wish the Principal, staff and students of Somerville International School all the very best.</p>                                                            </div>

Somerville International School is the latest addition to our schools. Here, we provide quality value- based education using the latest teaching aids. The school is air-conditioned to provide maximum comfort to our young ones, especially during the hot summer months. Extra-curricular activities are given due importance to provide an all-round development of the personality of each child.</p>

<p>Our goal is to create a warm, caring, and safe environment where our young charges have the opportunity to reach their highest potential. Our pedagogy motivates the students to become life-long learners and to improve their self-esteem and confidence to become good citizens and leaders of our great country.</p>

<p>Times have changed and the demand put on students today is quite different and more stressful than those of a few decades ago. Careful planning and a good relationship between the school and parents is a must as it can make your child&rsquo;s experience in our school a pleasant one. Success in school requires thoughtful organisation and commitment from all concerned. When the home and school work hand in hand with a shared vision, we can make a positive and rewarding change in the future of our children. We look forward to your full hearted cooperation in this mutually beneficial alliance.</p>

<p>The Lott Carey Baptist Mission in India&rsquo;s newest school Somerville International School started functioning on April 1st, 2013.</p>

<p>Somerville Schools are known for the high standards they set. Our Principals motivate our teachers to give their best and encourage students to discover their latent talents and develop them whether in the field of academics or in the varied extra-curricular activities planned for them during the academic session.</p>

<p>Our Annual Days and Sports Days are enjoyed by the parents. They appreciate our efforts in bringing out the best in their children. Most importantly, Somerville Schools are committed to inculcate in our students a value system that will stand by them when they go out into the world and take their place as responsible citizens. Somerville International will carry forward the traditions laid down by its sister schools with pride and the pledge to raise the bar by introducing innovative modern teaching methods, and providing additional facilities to our students.</p>

<p>The Lott Carey Baptist Mission in India along with the Principal and Staff of the school assure the parents who have placed their children in our care that they have made the right choice.</p>

<p>With their support and belief in us we can only look forward to a successful partnership in making their children confident students who will make their mark in the world.</p>                                                            </div>

<p>It is my honour and privilege to greet you with warm prayerful wishes that you be showered with abundant blessings from the Almighty.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Your attitude is either the lock on or key to your door to success&rdquo;.<br />
Denis Waitley</em></p>

<p>Each of us, sooner or later, goes through a moment or a situation when it seems that we are on the wrong road, and life is moving in the wrong direction. But&hellip; this is also true that some things are within our control and what disturbs us are not events or situations, but our attitude towards them.</p>

<p>Dear all, I wish you the blessing of a positive attitude, and this is what we also try to build in our students. We, at the Somerville Schools, strive to provide a platform where a child is holistically educated, encompassing physical (physiological), mental (cognitive), social, emotional (psychological) and spiritual growth. We aim that our students become a resource for tomorrow.</p>

<p>We accentuate learning by synergy and collaboration and this surely comes with a positive attitude towards life. Every student at Somerville is given a voice and avenue where they are able to express their knowledge, dream big and achieve big.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;As water reflects the face, so one&rsquo;s life reflects the heart&rdquo;.<br />
Proverbs 27:19</em></p>

<p>I am confident that at Somerville Schools, everyone will understand the true meaning of life, love life and live life to its fullest with the Almighty as the guide, and reach the heights of glory.</p>

<p>May the Almighty Lord, continue to protect and bless our schools.</p>                                                            </div>
